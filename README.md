# Fugu
Fugu is a game engine that I will develop while I learn game engine concepts like computer graphics, event systems, renderer structures, input handling, logging, etc.

Todo:
  - Lighting
  - Material System
  - Model Loading
  - Profiling
  - Advanced concepts (AA, Shadow/Normal mapping, batch rendering, cubemaps, PBR, etc.)
